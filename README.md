# Religions

## Agbara

This religion is followed by the humans living in Ikule, the death lands, a continent in the east part of the world where living conditions are very harsh and resources are scarce. People praise the gods so that they can survive and live in these lands.
Every person receives a mark when born from Ataiku that represents his strength (from 1-3) and society is ruled by these marks.
The people live in cities built alongside the few rivers that are present in the lands, while most of the lands are inhabited by them. The strongest warriors often form parties to explore the wastelands and to fight the monsters present there to seize powerful resources.

## Gods

### Ataiku:

Ataiku is the King of the Gods, a deity with unparalleled strength and power. He guides with a firm but just hands, and he respects power and will while he despises weak minds and cowardice. Everytime a baby is born in the death lands, he personally seeks through the baby’s spirit and gives him a visible mark based on his will power. There are 3 different marks that a person can receive and these marks rule the hierarchy. People with the lowest will power and marks are used for easy work and labor, while the highest marks people are considered noble and perform the highest-ranking jobs.
Since he is the king of gods, other gods follow his respect for strength and will in the same way.

### Ataiku Champion - Merin:

Merin is a wise and powerful human that was the first and only person to ever receive a level-4 mark from Ataiku when born. He was chosen by Ataiku for his unbreakable will, strength and willingness to achieve perfection. He lives in the capital of the lands, Ireti, and he is the commander of the main party there. To fight he uses a golden staff that radiates magical light powers that can be broken in a shield and spear for melee.


### Omi:

Omi, the Queen of Agbara and the wife of Ataiku, is a strong deity that controls water and flows and for this reason the people praise her as the queen of life (since they can't live without rivers). She has a rivalry since ancient times with Aini, the demon of siccity and death. In combat she controls water to create a fluid armor, and she creates in her right hand a water shark that she uses as a weapon (see lion fists of Hinata), and in her left hand some tentacles that she uses to block the impact of attacks and to physically block her enemy entangling it before attacking with the shark.


### Omi Champion - Oshun:

Oshun is Omi’s champion, a human water priestess that was chosen by the god when she once ventured with a party into the wastelands and survived an attack from Aini, the demon of siccity an death.
