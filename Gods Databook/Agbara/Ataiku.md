# Ataiku

## Description

Ataiku is the King of the Gods, a deity with unparalleled strength and power. He guides with a firm but just hands, and he respects power and will while he despises weak minds and cowardice. Everytime a baby is born in the death lands, he personally seeks through the babyâ€™s spirit and gives him a visible mark based on his will power. There are 3 different marks that a person can receive and these marks rule the hierarchy. People with the lowest will power and marks are used for easy work and labor, while the highest marks people are considered noble and perform the highest-ranking jobs.
Since he is the king of gods, other gods follow his respect for strength and will in the same way.
