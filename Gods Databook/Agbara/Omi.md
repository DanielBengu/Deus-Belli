# Omi

## Description

Omi, the Queen of Agbara and the wife of Ataiku, is a strong deity that controls water and flows and for this reason the people praise her as the queen of life (since they can't live without rivers). She has a rivalry since ancient times with Aini, the demon of siccity and death. In combat she controls water to create a fluid armor, and she creates in her right hand a water shark that she uses as a weapon (see lion fists of Hinata), and in her left hand some tentacles that she uses to block the impact of attacks and to physically block her enemy entangling it before attacking with the shark.
