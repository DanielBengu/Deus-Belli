## Description

Teriba is the god of the hunt and the provider of food for the people. He uses a contraption in his hand that opens and becomes a big crossbow. When the people hunt a big beast, to honor this god they cut the beast’s head and leave it as an offering to the god, and they bring the body to the city for consumption.

## Champion - Eranko

Eranko is Teriba’s champion, she was once a beast that lived in the wastelands and was chosen by the god after she became the apex predator of the most dangerous zone in the wastelands. 
After becoming a champion she gained human-like features and to this day she keeps living in the wastes, surviving by killing his enemies. 
She isn’t an enemy of the people and sometimes joins a party when there’s a particularly strong enemy to hunt.
